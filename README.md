## A React-App with a Scoreboard that can be updated

The AFL point scoring system is as follows:

- For each goal, the team recieves 6 points
- For each behind, the team recieves 1 point

As such, the afl_scoreboard (with the starting position being the final score of the 2005 grand final) updates the total scores of the two teams based on the amount of goals/behinds which can be edited with the blue +/- buttons.

This project introduced me to React and jsx. Through the undertaking of this website I developed an understanding and experience of the use and linking of React Components.

The website is deployed at: https://my-scorecard.surge.sh/
